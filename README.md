## What I've Learnt
As this is my first full-stack development project, I have a few things I have picked up over the course of developing this project.

1. I learnt the importance of structuring the project nicely at the outset. For example, separating the models, controllers, and routes distinctly into individual folders.

2. *** Work out a clear user story BEFORE diving into actual development. Learnt this the hard way as I started off with a very complicated project - users can CREATE requests and allow other users to join their 'food parties' while waiting for another user to 'lead' the party by promising delivery. Complicating, isn't it? After the course, I distilled the project down to what it currently is and the code became much more manageable.

3. Time is a heck of a thing to manipulate in Javascript. Until one discovers MomentJS :)
